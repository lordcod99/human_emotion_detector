# human_emotion_detector
## using CNN for training and Harrcascade algorithm to detect faces 
- [Emotionfinder_training.ipynb](https://github.com/lordcod99/human_emotion_detector/Emotionfinder_training.ipynb) contains model training code 
- fer2013 cintain data set used to train it is available on [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashishpatel26/facial-expression-recognitionferchallenge)
- [detector.py](https://github.com/lordcod99/human_emotion_detector/blob/main/detector.py) where trained models are used
- In this project harrcascade algorithm is used to detect the face. It is old but powerfull algorithm pretrained model is available at [link](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades)
